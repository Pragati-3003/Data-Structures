<!-- Question Link ==> https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/description/ -->


Approach:-
The Dutch National Flag algorithm, also known as 3-way partitioning, is an algorithm for sorting an array containing three distinct values. The algorithm was designed to solve the problem of sorting an array containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s



class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        int low=0;
        int mid=0,high=nums.size()-1;
        while(mid<=high){
            if(nums[mid]==0){
                swap(nums[mid++],nums[low++]);
            }
            else if(nums[mid]==1)
            mid++;
            else{
                 swap(nums[mid],nums[high--]);
            }
        }
    }
};
